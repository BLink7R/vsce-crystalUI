# crystal UI README

The extension 'crystal UI' adds a background pic for your vscode.

## Features

1. press `ctrl+shift+p` , use the command `open crystal UI`
2. restart your vscode
3. change your theme to `'crystal UI'`

Then,your vscode will look like this:

![feature1](https://z131.xyz/img/feature1.jpg)

![feature2](https://z131.xyz/img/feature2.jpg)

It's beautiful,isn't it?  

This ext works by changing vscode's css file(to add a background,and it causes a alarm——just ignore it,I promise that this ext is harmless) and use a independent theme,which adds a opacity to your UI to show the background.

So if you want to turn it off,just choose another theme——this saves you from the trouble to reload vscode.**But remember to use the command `close crystal UI` to turn it off when you want to uninstall this ext!!**

## By the way

The little cat in my editor is not included in this ext,you can search the ext `'background'` to add a background to your editor.If you want the source picture of this cat,you can download the app `'JIKE'`.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `crystalUI.opacity`: the opacity of ui in crystal mode,including the titlebar,the sidebar and the activitybar.
* `crystalUI.listsOpacity`: the opacity of lists in crystal mode.
* `crystalUI.backpicPath`: the **absolute** path of the background picture,default if set to *null*.
* `crystalUI.foreground`: if true,the background will float above the whole window. It may looks cool,but it make you hard to recognize the words in the editor. So I strongly recommand you set it to false.
